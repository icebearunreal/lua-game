Please note that right now, the game is in a critically broken state.
Ok lesgo fix the damn thing 

### THE GAME'S IDEA:
Game concept not yet designed
but
you are a player
you catch falling balls
If you catch a ball, a ghost-ball spawns that moves horizontally and sometimes catches balls for you. THis is helpful. After catching 1 ball, the ghost-ball that caught it will disappear.
The score system speaks for itself:
    IF YOU CATCH A BALL: + 1 
    MISS (THE BALL'S Y > YOUR Y): -1 HEARTS
